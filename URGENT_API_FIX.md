# 🚨 URGENT: API Request Failed - Backend Not Deployed

## Problem Identified
The PHP backend files are not uploaded to Hostinger. Requests to `https://jdmarcng.com/backend/` return the main website HTML instead of PHP API responses.

## Immediate Solution Required

### Step 1: Upload Backend Files to Hostinger
Upload ALL files from `/hostinger-backend/` to your Hostinger File Manager:

**Target Location:** `public_html/backend/`

**Required Files:**
```
public_html/backend/
├── index.php
├── config.php
├── .htaccess
├── database.sql
├── test-connection.php
└── api/
    ├── signup.php
    ├── login.php
    ├── logout.php
    ├── profile.php
    └── update-user.php
```

### Step 2: Create Database Tables
1. Access your Hostinger MySQL database
2. Run the SQL commands from `database.sql`
3.# 🚨 URGENT API FIX REQUIRED - CONFIRMED ISSUE

## ❌ PROBLEM CONFIRMED
**Status:** PHP backend files are NOT uploaded to Hostinger
**Evidence:** 
- `https://jdmarcng.com/backend/index.php` returns HTML (React app) instead of JSON
- `https://jdmarcng.com/backend/` returns HTML instead of API directory
- Apache fallback routing is serving React app for all `/backend/` requests

## 🔧 ROOT CAUSE
The `/deployment-package-backend/` files exist locally but have **NEVER been uploaded** to Hostinger's `public_html/backend/` directory.

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### Method 1: Hostinger File Manager (RECOMMENDED)
1. **Login:** Hostinger control panel → File Manager
2. **Navigate:** `public_html/` directory
3. **Create:** `backend/` folder (if missing)
4. **Upload:** ALL files from local `/deployment-package-backend/`
5. **Verify:** Directory structure matches deployment package

### Method 2: FTP Upload
```bash
Host: srv1847.hstgr.io
User: u158969833_JDM
Pass: 1~mPr^A60mH
Remote Path: /public_html/backend/
```

## 📁 CRITICAL FILES TO UPLOAD
```
public_html/backend/
├── index.php (846 bytes) - API health endpoint
├── config.php (2,031 bytes) - Database connection
├── .htaccess (1,010 bytes) - CORS & routing
├── database.sql (2,516 bytes) - Schema & seed data
├── test-connection.php (1,540 bytes) - Connection test
└── api/
    ├── login.php (2,564 bytes)
    ├── logout.php (528 bytes)
    ├── profile.php (1,227 bytes)
    ├── signup.php (2,036 bytes)
    └── update-user.php (3,664 bytes)
```

## 🗄️ DATABASE SETUP (AFTER UPLOAD)
1. Access Hostinger MySQL database
2. Run SQL commands from `database.sql`
3. Verify 10 user accounts created

## ✅ POST-UPLOAD VERIFICATION
**These URLs MUST return JSON (not HTML):**
- `https://jdmarcng.com/backend/index.php` → Database status JSON
- `https://jdmarcng.com/backend/test-connection.php` → Connection test results

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS
- ❌ **CRITICAL:** Backend files not uploaded to Hostinger
- ❌ **BLOCKING:** All API requests failing (returns HTML)
- ❌ **IMPACT:** Users cannot login or access dashboards
- ✅ **READY:** Frontend performance fixes deployed
- ✅ **READY:** Deployment packages prepared and tested

**PRIORITY:** Upload backend files immediately to restore API functionalityunning",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-18T03:09:00.000Z",
  "database": "connected",
  "users_count": 10
}
```
### Step 3: Test Backend
After upload, test these URLs:
- `https://jdmarcng.com/backend/index.php` (should return JSON)
- `https://jdmarcng.com/backend/test-connection.php` (database test)
- `https://jdmarcng.com/backend/api/login` (API endpoint)

## Quick Upload Instructions

### Option A: Hostinger File Manager
1. Login to Hostinger control panel
2. Go to File Manager
3. Navigate to `public_html/`
4. Create `backend/` folder
5. Upload all files from local `/hostinger-backend/`

### Option B: FTP Upload
```bash
# Use any FTP client with these credentials:
Host: srv1847.hstgr.io
Username: u158969833_JDM
Password: 1~mPr^A60mH
Directory: /public_html/backend/
```

## Expected API Response
After upload, `https://jdmarcng.com/backend/index.php` should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "Builder Aura Field API is running",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-18T03:09:00.000Z",
  "database": "connected",
  "users_count": 10
}
```

## Test Login
```bash
curl -X POST https://jdmarcng.com/backend/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@jdmarcng.com","password":"Admin@123","departmentCode":"SA1234"}'
```

**The API will work immediately after uploading the backend files to Hostinger.**
